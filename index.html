    Hello I am Gülistan and welcome to my Resume Project page. This page will be one of my first projects in Web Development.
    I was thinking about learning to program in order to be able to build websites for a while now and finally got myself to start with it.
    It is still a long way to go, with Development or Tech in general you will never stop learning I guess but that is the beauty of it. 
    Funny enough my background is in Aviation. I love exploring be it by travel or by learning new things such as languages or even programming. 
    Below you can even find a map with places I have already explored and I am not planning on stopping to add destinations any time soon. 
    This Website will be my playground where I will be playing around with new functions, which I learn in order to up my skills step by
    step. It will end up being a testimonial of my first steps & growth within web development even if it is just a hobby for now.

        One Quote I read the other day, which was really suiting the occassion is<br/>
        <i>''Everything is hard before it is easy''</i><br/>
        <i>Goethe J.W.</i>
